# my thoughts

lage failed to download
pants not matching sha signature

pants does not support js that well really
all the examples are in other languages
<https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.18/docs/getting-started/example-projects-and-repositories>

nx is a pain, and Guilherme didn't get it right too

turbo is nice, workable batteries included and UI and science logic t separation

bit

- excellent pnpm integration
- good clit with download ETA, feature rich
- can be used alongside turborepo
a full system of stuffs , quite complex, not sure how well it is to use
one more abstraction layer tbh

bit sounds like too much for now. going with turborepo for now


## discussion
<https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/yhzf3f/nx_vs_turborepo_concerned_about_betting_on_either/>

- [ ] turborepo <https://turbo.build/> <https://github.com/vercel/turbo> 24k from vercel - not our use case quite
- [ ] vs nx <https://github.com/nrwl/nx>
- [ ] rushstack - less known microsoft product <https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack>
