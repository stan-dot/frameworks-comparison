# frontend routing proposal

possibly to mirror the API struture

what is easier to maintain - a system with overhead with many confg files?
or regular `tsx` that's hundreds of files but easier to update?

each file quite simple
extractable component into a new page
beamline config - booleans and optional stuff, central panel all the time
